# ImageTexture for Babylon.js

[![js-semistandard-style](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-semistandard-brightgreen.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/Flet/semistandard)

A simple addon class which allows to use HTMLImageElements as a Babylon.js texture right away.

Small testbed for some fancy JS stuff as well. Used VSCode, es6 (well..that's already boring), semistandards (meh).
